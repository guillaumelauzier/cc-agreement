This smart contract defines a basic structure for tokenizing generative artworks and storing their information. It also emits an event when a new artwork is tokenized. You will need to expand upon this contract and add functionality for custom licensing, distribution of proceeds, and other relevant features based on the terms of the agreement. Additionally, you should consult with legal professionals and blockchain experts to ensure the smart contract complies with all relevant regulations.
